# Batch Wi-Fi Brute Forcer
An online attack tool against Wi-Fi networks with internal CMD commands.

## Usage

### 1) Interface initialization
Program automatically detects your wireless interfaces when you execute the batchfile.
If it finds only one, it will select it as default. If there are multiple interfaces,
program will ask you to choose one. If none exists, it will stay "not_defined".

> You can later change the interface by typing `interface` on the main menu.
> This will bring the interface initialization screen back.

### 2) Scan
When you type `scan` at the main menu, the program will enumerate all Wi-Fi networks
available from the selected wireless interface. You can choose one by typing the number
associated with an SSID.

> No Name could mean that the network is hidden. You cannot attack that network.

### 3) Selecting a wordlist
You have to specify the wordlist file you are going to use by typing `wordlist` on the 
main menu. You can provide a file which is relatively positioned in the program directory
or you can give full path.

### 4) Attacking
Simply type `attack` and program will show you a warning screen that this process is going
to delete the profile associated with the SSID if you have connected to it before.
It means you will lose the password you entered while connecting to that SSID before.
Save it before using the attack.

## Limitations
- This program is created for Windows 10. Since some commands may differ in terms of output between Windows versions,
it is not expected to work on previous versions.

- Speed is significantly slow due to its nature.

- Cannot attack hidden networks.

## Result file
If an attack was successful, the result is automatically written to `result.txt`.
